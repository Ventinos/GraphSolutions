# Graph Theory problems and solutions
This repo contains answers to various exercises involving graph theory which we solved for a course at university
## Files:
Each file contains either a PDF or a PNG with the problem, a PDF with a presentation ((in portuguese)) we made for the course which is labeled with EP somewhere in the name, and various .cpp and .hpp files which comprise the actual solution
